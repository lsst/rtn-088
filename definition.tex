\section{Milestone description} \label{sec:definition}

This milestone is about USDF being ready for LSSTCam which will go on sky in 2025 - flats etc will arrive in 2024.

At a broad level this means getting LSSTCam and ancillary data from the summit to USDF and having it accessible to users.

This entails USDF :

\begin{itemize}
\item data auto-transferred from summit to USDF; ingested in butler
\item LFA replication to USDF (Ceph -> Ceph to start)
\item automated prompt processing
\item EFD data available at USDF
\item access to data from batch/RSP for staff and commissioners.
\end{itemize}
